            <p>Farmdrop is a British sustainable and ethical food delivery company which provides customers with farm-fresh food, locally-sourced fish, everyday essentials and household goods. They are on a mission to “fix the food chain” and pay farmers 70% of profits made from food they sell.</p>

              <p class="text-gray">The outcome</p>
              <p>In just 2 weeks our team of 3 researched and created a high fidelity prototype of an app that gamified health tracking. Through syncing shopping points and viewing health data, Farmdrop customers could unlock events to attend with their friends.</p>

When we asked how they found out about Farmdrop we discovered it was typically through a friend’s recommendation, so we knew inviting friends along to events through a free ticket could be a great way to further build the Farmdrop community.</p>
          <p>Enter Cultivate—an app which rewards customers for making healthy choices through unlocking fun events to attend with friends, whilst offering a more balanced approach to keeping fit and healthy.</p>
