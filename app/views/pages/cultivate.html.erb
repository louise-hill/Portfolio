            <h6>Background</h6>
            <p>Farmdrop is a British sustainable and ethical food delivery company which provides customers with farm-fresh food, locally-sourced fish, everyday essentials and household goods. They are on a mission to “fix the food chain” and pay farmers 70% of profits made from food they sell.</p>

              <p>In just 2 weeks our team of 3 researched and created a high fidelity prototype of an app that gamified health tracking. Through syncing shopping points and viewing health data, Farmdrop customers could unlock events to attend with their friends.</p>

          <p>We noticed another nice business opportunity. Our interviewees led busy social lives and loved to attend events with their friends. When we asked how they found out about Farmdrop we discovered it was typically through a friend’s recommendation, so we knew inviting friends along to events through a free ticket could be a great way to further build the Farmdrop community.</p>
          <p>Enter Cultivate—an app which rewards customers for making healthy choices through unlocking fun events to attend with friends, whilst offering a more balanced approach to keeping fit and healthy.</p>
