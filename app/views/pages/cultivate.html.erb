              <p>Farmdrop is a British sustainable and ethical food delivery company which provides customers with farm-fresh food, locally-sourced fish, everyday essentials and household goods. They are on a mission to “fix the food chain” and pay farmers 70% of profits made from food they sell.</p>

So how could Farmdrop help? We noticed a trend in feeling guilty or bad when not hitting lifestyle goals. We saw an opportunity to offer health-tracking with a unique twist...</p>

          <p>We had to incorporate Farmdrop’s values and culture. We needed to create a product which fit seemlessly with their current mix of apps and services. We had to be carefull to consider ethical implications around data collection. We needed to build trust and make sure the user would be fully in control of how they share and track their data.</p>

          <p>We noticed another nice business opportunity. Our interviewees led busy social lives and loved to attend events with their friends. When we asked how they found out about Farmdrop we discovered it was typically through a friend’s recommendation, so we knew inviting friends along to events through a free ticket could be a great way to further build the Farmdrop community. Enter Cultivate—an app which rewards customers for making healthy choices through unlocking fun events to attend with friends, whilst offering a more balanced approach to keeping fit and healthy.</p>
