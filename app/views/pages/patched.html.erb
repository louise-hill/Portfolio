            <p>We had a day of class-time to hash out the product design, plus evenings and weekends to refine the details, then we coded the app in 8 days.</p>

          <p>I had an afternoon to come up with an app idea so I interviewed a friend. He is an organic gardening enthusiast and opened my eyes to the difficulties of keeping away pests without using harmful chemicals.</p>
          <p>I spoke to a few friends who have recently bought their first house and asked them about their gardens. What jumped out was an enthusiasm for eco-friendly gardening, but uncertainty around how to actually get started. A quick Google highlighted a problem in tracking down clear gardening information for beginners.</p>
